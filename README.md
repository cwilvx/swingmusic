### Make listening to your local music fun again.

`Swing` is a music player for local audio files that is built with both visual coolness and functionality in mind. Just run the app and enjoy your music library in a web browser.

> Note: This project is in the early stages of development. Many features are missing but will be added with time.

The app is currently only available on linux. (I don't have access to a Windows machine for building and testing purposes).

#### ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Checkout the app screenshots in [this excalidraw canvas](https://excalidraw.com/#json=b52G7e9g-dYhMmcyQy9El,pMWhoENuMZgC6mPgyMmU-g) ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

### Setup

Download the latest release from the [release page](#), make the binary file executable and run it in a terminal. You can do all this using the commands below.

```bash
wget https://github.com/geoffrey45/swingmusic/releases/download/linux-beta/swingmusic

chmod a+x ./swingmusic

./swingmusic
```

The app should start at <http://localhost:1970> by default.

```
Usage: swingmusic [options]

```

### Docker Build

**Clone repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geoffrey45/swingmusic.git
cd swingmusic
```

**Build**

```bash
docker build . -t swingmusic
```

**Run**

```bash
docker run -p 1970:1970 -v /path/to/config/volume:/root/.swing -v /path/to/music:/root/music:ro swingmusic:latest
```

Update the volumes for the full path to where the config and music folders reside.

> Note: Remove `:ro` in the music volume to allow writing to it, make sure you got backups ect..

### Development

This project is broken down into 2. The client and the server. The client comprises of the user interface code. This part is written in Typescript, Vue 3 and SCSS. To setup the client, checkout the [swing client repo ](https://github.com/geoffrey45/swing-client) on GitHub.

The second part of this project is the server. This is the main part of the app that runs on your machine, interacts with audio files and send data to the client. It's written in Python 3.

The following instructions will guide you on how to setup the **server**.

---

The project uses [Python poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as the virtual environment manager. Follow the instructions in [their docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install it in your machine.

> It is assumed that you have `Python 3.10` or newer installed in your machine. This project uses duck typing features so older version of Python will not work. If you don't have Python installed in your machine, get it from the [python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone this repo locally in your machine. Then install the project dependencies and start the app.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/geoffrey45/swingmusic.git

cd swingmusic

# install dependencies using poetry
poetry install

# start the app
poetry run python manage.py
```

### A brain dump ...

I started working on this project on dec 2021. Why? I like listening and exploring music and I like it more when I can enjoy it (like really really). I'd been searching for cute music players for linux that allow me to manage my ever growing music library. Some of the main features I was looking for were:

- A simple and beautiful user interface (main reason)
- Creating automated daily mixes based on my listening activity.
- Ability to move files around without breaking my playlists and mixes.
- Something that can bring together all the audio files scattered all over my disks into a single place.
- Browsing related artists and albums.
- Reading albums & artists biographies and getting insights on song lyrics (kinda Genium.com-ish).
- Web browser based user interface.
- a lot more ... but I can't remember them at the moment

I've been working to make sure that most (if not all) of the features listed above are built. Some of them are done, but most are not even touched yet. A lot of work is needed and I know that it will take a lot of time to build and perfect them.

I've been keeping a small ðŸ¤¥ list of a few cool features that I'd like to build in future. Some of the features listed there are outright stupid but some are cool. You can check it out in [this notion page](https://rhetorical-othnielia-565.notion.site/Cool-features-1a0cd5b797904da687bec441e7c7aa19). https://rhetorical-othnielia-565.notion.site/Cool-features-1a0cd5b797904da687bec441e7c7aa19

I have been working on this project solo, so itâ€™s very hard to push things fast. If you have programming knowledge in Python or Vue, feel free to contribute to the project. Weâ€™ll be excited to have you. Your help is highly appreciated.
